# Glossary

## Vocabulary to Use:

### Development and General Terms

#### Portfolio, Page, and Section.
* Terms used to denote the componenets of a user's portfolio. A portfolio contains multiple pages, and each page contains multiple sections.
Sections have different types and can display text, media, or a combination of both.
* **Example**: My ‘Professional portfolio’ has an ‘About me’ and ‘Achievements’ page.
My ‘About me’ page contains sections for ‘Qualifications’, ‘Aspirations’ and a professional headshot.

#### Primary Portfolio
* The portfolio that is initially rendered on the display page when a logged in user connects to app.jinx.systems.

#### Authentication
* The process of defining who a user is. This can be done through a username password tuple or through a token.

#### Token
* A string used to authenticate the user.

#### Permission
* What a user is allowed to do. The user needs to be authenticated before permissions can be checked.

#### Portfolio Dropdown
* The dropdown menu from which a user can choose edit their chosen portfolio, change their portfolio's theme, copy the portfolio link, or change the portfolio's privacy. Only accessible to logged in users.

#### User Dropdown
* The dropdown menu from which a user can choose to log out. Future account settings will be accessed from here in the future.

#### Portfolio Layout
* Refers to the structure and ordering of portfolio elements (pages, sections).
* **Example**: My portfolio layout displays my pages in the order ‘About me’, ‘Past projects’ (left to right). My ‘About me’ page displays my sections in the order ‘Selfie’, ‘Career objective’, ‘Personality’ (top to bottom on the ‘About me’ page).

#### Responsive 
* Term used to describe a site that automatically adjusts its content depending on the size of the screen of the user.
* **Example**: We want to make sure that our site is adaptive so that users can view it on their phones and on their desktop computers


### Areas of the App

*The term 'page' used here is not a standard page (which is used to denote a data object), but instead refers to the seperate webpages of the project. Hopefully there will be little ambiguity.* 

#### Edit Page
* Refers to the webpage in which a user edits their portfolio content. This term will hopefully become obsolete once we implement WYSIWYG edit mode.
New users are directed to the edit-page when they login for the first time.

#### Landing Page
* Refers to the initial web page users are directed to when they connect to app.jinx.systems, and they are not logged in.

#### Portfolio Page OR Display Page
* Refers to the page on which a user's portfolio is actually displayed with the chosen theme, and subsequently viewed by other users if the link to the page is shared. From this page, a user can choose the theme of their portfolio, share the page's link, and toggle the page's privacy.


## Vocabulary **NOT** to Use

#### Home Page
* Ambiguous term often confused with ‘landing page’, or any other page that a user may be redircted to upon acessing app.jinx.systems. Do not use it. 

#### Profile Page
* An ambiguous term often confused for a user's primary portfolio, which could display a portfolio of any nature. We don’t have dedicated ‘profiles’ in our product, a user can choose to make a portfolio which displays their personal or professional details if they wish.
