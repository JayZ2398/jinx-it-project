# Documentation

This directory holds an almost complete list of documentation that we've created over the semester. 

For our more informal notes, and a greater insight into our process throughout the semester, please consult our Google Docs shared drive (especially the minutes file).

Our presentation can be viewed [here](https://app.jinx.systems/u/jinxteam).

#### Our documentation consists of 2 parts:

Sprint artefacts in accordance with SCRUM methodology are in `artefacts/`:
* All diagrams, including motivational model, architecture diagram and database schema (`diagrams/`)
* Screenshots of our Trello board throughout the semester, documenting our workflow (`trello/`)
* Wireframes/Figma mockups of our UI design (`wireframes/`)
* Notes from our meetings with the client (`Client_Meetings.pdf`)
* Documents for each sprint which include planning, review, and retrospective (`Epics_and_Product_Backlog.pdf`)
* Personas (`Personas.pdf`)
* Glossary to ensure consistent communication (`glossary.md`)

Guides to assist with our development are in `guides`:
* Git usage and preferred protocols
* Style guides
* Notes on Agile and SCRUM methodologies
* Helpful presentations
* Notes on Vim usage

Layer-specific information can also be found in the `readme` files of the respective folders:
- `src/frontend/`
- `src/backend/`
- `deploy/`

Our less formal minutes documentation is [accessible here (you must be signed into a University of Melbourne Google account).](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lZHzJGFCXUFKqDrTwBtxOW7lKHzEN2dSZDAkhdDrYM4/edit?usp=sharing)
