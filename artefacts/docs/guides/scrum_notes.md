# SCRUM
*A framework within which people can address complex, adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimise predictability and control risk.*

Scrum binds together:
* Roles
* Events
* Artifacts
* Rules


# Scrum Theory

3 Central Pillars: 
* Transparency
  * Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome
  * These aspects must defined by a common standard (e.g. an ubiquitous definition of 'done' throughout the team)
* Inspection
  * Artifacts and progress towards the goal must be frequently inspected by the team to detect undesirable variances
  * Should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of work
* Adaptation
  * If inspection yields a deviation from the outlined process, and the resulting product thus unaccpetable, then adjustments must be made as soon as possible

4 Formal Events for Inspection -> Adaptation:
* Sprint Planning
* Weekly Scrum (Daily for most projects)
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospective

# Scrum Team Roles

## Product Owner  
Responsible for managing the Product backlog. Includes:
  * Prioritising items in the Product Backlog with respect to their importance in achieving the goal
  * Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all
  * Ensures software meets business / client requirements
## The Development Team 
Self-explanatory. Qualities of a good development team are:
  * Self-organising. No one tells the Development Team how to turn the Product Backlog into increments of potentiall releasable functionality
  * No titles and no sub-teams within the team, regardless of domains that need to be addressed (front-end, back-end, testing)
  * Individual team members may have specialised skills, but accountability belongs to the team as a whole
## Scrum Master
Responsible for ensuring that all team members follow Scrum principles. Includes:
  * Ensuring that goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the team as well as possible
  * Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed
  * Guiding the team in the practice of Scrum principles and ensuring their adoption by the team as a whole

# Scrum Artifacts

Artifacts represent work or value that provide transparency and oppurtunities for inspection and adaptation. Artifacts defined by Scrum are specifically designed to maximise transparency of key info so that everybody has the same understanding of the artifact.

Scrum relies on transparency so everyone can make decisions the optimise value and control risk. Thus the transparency of all artifacts must be continually assessed, with the meaning of all artifacts and their respective items collectively agreed upon by the Scrum Team. 

## Product Backlog
* An ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.
* Lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases.
* A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it lays out the initally known and best understood requirements. 
* The Product Backlog evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used evolve. It is constantly refined over time, with items being *ordered* with respect to their priority. Higher ordered items are clearer and more detailed

## Sprint Backlog
* Consists of the set of all Product Backlog items chosen for the current Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them
* Should be a plan with enough detail such that changes in progress can be understood in the Weekly Scrum 
* The Dev Team modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint. Priorities may be changed, items added or removed is correspondence with changing estimates, but the Sprint Goal never changes

## Increment
* The sum of all Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint, and the value of the Increments of all previous Sprints.
* At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be 'Done', whcih means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team's definition of 'Done'.
* the Increment must be in useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it.


# The Sprint

All events are time-boxed, such that every event has a maximum duration. Apart from the Sprint itself (the container for all events) each Scrum event is a formal oppurtunity to inspect and adapt something.

The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, during which a 'Done', useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints are of a fixed duration, and a new Sprint starts immeadiately after the conclusion of the previous.

## During the Sprint
* No changes are to be made that endanger the sprint goal
* Quality goals *do not* decrease
* Scope may be clarified and renegotiated between the Product Owner and Dev Team as more is learned

## Sprint Planning
Outline of the upcoming Sprint and is the collaborative work of the entire Scrum team. Strive to answer the following:

  * Planning Conversation
    * What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
    * The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, and the past performance of the Dev Team. 
    * The number of items selected from the Product Backlog is solely up to the Dev Team.
    * Outline a Sprint Goal. 
      * This is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog, providing guidance to the Dev team on *why* it's building an Increment, and subsequently *what* to choose from the Product Backlog 

  * Plan the sprint
    * How will the work needed to deliver the increment be achieved?
    * Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items, the Dev Team decides on the technical details of *how* it will build this functionality into a 'Done' product Increment
    * The Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them, is called the Sprint Backlog.
  
  * Recap plan / 1st action item
    * Verbal approval of what the team is commiting to
    * Ensure everyone knows what their 1st action item is

## Weekly Scrum
* Used to be called standups but name changed out of respect for people who have difficulty standing.
* A short, fixed length event for the Dev Team.
* Used to inspect how progress is trending towards completing the work in the Sprint Backlog
* Set development goals for the coming week
* Adaptations and replanning of Sprint Backlog priorities may occur

Every team member has a turn, answers three questions:
  1. What were they working on last week?
  2. What are they working on this week?
  3. Are there any blockers?
* Other team members are allowed to offer suggestions with regards to blockers.
* Team members should know what you're going to say before walking in


## Sprint Review
  * Review what's "done" / "not done"
    * Product owner looks at product backlog and reviews what's done / not done.

  * Demo work
    * Led by the development team
    * Demonstrate work accomplished
    * Team can make observations and ask questions ask questions, for example:
      * Satisfies customers problems?
      * Account for internal dependencies?
  
  * Review key metrics
    * Software should have some sort of measurable outcome
    * Check these metrics
  
  * Review and revise product backlog
    * Teams often add new user stories or remove old ones
    * Implementation and effects become clear in demo
    * Results in revised product backlog


## Sprint Retrospective:
  * Goals of the retrospective:
    * Evaluate last sprint
    * Create a shared understanding of things that worked well and things that didn't
    * Create a plan for improving the way the team works
  
  * Preperation
    * Gather:
      * Whiteboard / wall
      * Sticky notes
      * Pen
      * Timer
  * Set the stage
    * Remind everyone:
      * Make space for people's shortcomings
      * Keep positive spirit of improvement
      * Listen with open mind
      * Remain focused on outcomes not people
      * Leave phones at the door
  * What went well?
    * Set timer for 3 - 5 minutes
    * Everyone write on sticky notes as many ideas as possible
    * Uncover:
      * Team strengths
      * Awesome outcomes
      * 1 brief idea per sticky
      * Prevents complaining session
    * Once timer is done:
      * Go around the room for 10 - 15 minutes
      * Team member explains their note
      * Other team members can ask clarifying questions
      * Create shared understanding
      * Focus on umpathy and understanding not actions or implications
      * Group similar ideas
  * What needs improvement
    * Follow above steps
    * Resist temptation to:
      * Rebuke others
      * Jump straight to solutions
    * Table any such discussion
  * Next Steps
    * 20 - 25 minutes
    * What concrete actions can team take to improve things discussed above
    * Each team member has 3 votes
      * Votes used to decide what we need to take action on
    * Agree to:
      * Actions
      * Owners
      * Due Date
    * End of meeting:
      * Run through list of follow up items
        * Who is responsible?
